## Forward Kinematics via DH Parameters
- Symbols are not made functions of time
- Should be way to extract rotation and position matrix
- function that takes in position matrix and computes jacobian based on joint variables
- statics and forces calculator via jacobian transpose

## Inverse Kinematics 
- naive inverse kinematics calculator with minor changes in position and joint variables. calculated with jacobian inverse. reference to ildars slides
